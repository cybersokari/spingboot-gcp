## Before diving in ðŸ™Œ

- Our recommend IDE for this project is IntelliJ, but you can use any IDE that supports Springboot
- Request access to the `Google Cloud Developer Console` and `MongoDB Atlas console`
- Install the latest stable version of [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/docs/history.html). This will be your main version across your machine.

## Getting Started ðŸš€

This project contains 2 profiles:

- dev
- prod

To run the desired profile use `mvn spring-boot:run -P dev|prod`

### Setup MongoDB

### Setup Firebase Emulator locally
Follow the official Firebase guide to set up the emulator locally.


### Creating Routes
Routes can be found in `src/main/***/http/controller`

### Creating Mongo Documents and Repositories
Documents can be found in `src/main/***/model`
Repositories can be found in `src/main/***/repository`


### Logging
This app uses [Logback](https://logback.qos.ch/manual) for logging. You can find the config in `/src/main/resources` folder
When running in `prod` Logs are sent to [Cloud Logging](https://cloud.google.com/logging) via [Logback Cloud logging plugin](https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/setup/java).
The Logback plugin only reports logs from the LF4J logging API, so we only use the `org.slf4j.Logger` interface for logging.
When running in `dev` profile, logs are configured to write to the console.

Use this [setup to configure Docker](https://docs.docker.com/config/containers/logging/gcplogs/) to work with Cloud Logging when moving to a new VM

### Secrets Management ðŸ”’
We use Google Cloud Secrets Manager to manage secrets (API keys, passwords, database URLs, etc.)

## Deployments

Deployments are currently automated via GitHub actions. The workflow file is located at ``/.github/workflows/deploy.yml``
The app runs on a Google Compute Engine VM with full GCP API permissions and required scopes.

### Building the production docker image on a new machine
1. Install Docker and Gcloud CLI
2. Run ``gcloud auth application-default login`` to authenticate with Google Cloud Platform
3. Run ``CP $HOME/.config/gcloud/application_default_credentials.json cred.json`` from the project root folder.
4. Run ``docker build -t <IMAGE_NAME> -f Dockerfile . --build-arg PROJECT_ID=<GCP_PROJECT_ID>`` to build the docker image.\
   Replace the `<GCP_PROJECT_ID>` with the appropriate Google Cloud Project ID.\
   Replace `Dockerfile` with `native.Dockerfile` if you want to build the GraalVM native docker image.\
   Replace `IMAGE_NAME` with `jvm` or `native` to match the service name in the `docker-compose.yml` file if you want to run the images locally.
5. Temporarily allow the production MongoDB Atlas to accept traffic from your local machine's IP address.
6. Run ``docker-compose up <service-name>`` from the project root folder. Use `jvm` or `native` as the service name.


### Publishing a new version to Google Artifact Registry
You will need to have write access to our Google Artifact Registry on Google Cloud Platform and install docker on your machine.
1. Run ``gcloud auth configure-docker us-central1-docker.pkg.dev`` to enable [Google Cloud CLI to authenticate requests to Artifact Registry](https://cloud.google.com/artifact-registry/docs/docker/store-docker-container-images#linux).
2. Run the ``docker tag web <GCP_IMAGE_NAME> && docker push <GCP_IMAGE_NAME>`` command to publish the new version to Google Artifact Registry.


### Updating the container image with the new image version
It takes the Compute Engine VM 20 to 30 seconds to update the container image. So we try not to run the following command
at peak hours of the day if possible.
```shell
$ gcloud compute instances update-container [instance-name] --zone=[zone-name] --container-image=[container-image-name]
```
Replace the `instance-name`, `zone-name` and `container-image-name` with the appropriate values.

### Inspecting the app on the VM
While will not need to log into the VM to get Telementry information, you can SSH into the VM and run the following command to inspect the app
1. Run ``docker ps`` to view the docker instances running
2. Run ``docker attach [container-id]`` to attach to the container and start seeing logs. Note that you will only see logs from when you attach, not the past logs.

Use Cloud logging to inspect the logs and health of the machine.


### Tests ðŸ§ª
#### Unit test
#### Integration test
The goal is to achieve close to production behaviour as possible. Database and Repositories are powered by
an [Embedded DB](https://github.com/flapdoodle-oss/de.flapdoodle.embed.mongo) that only runs in `test` profile.

1. `Mockito` is used for Mocking external services
2. `MockMvc` is used for the Integration test

While ``mvn clean test`` is good for running the tests during development, we advise you use the following command to build the `test.Dockerfile` 
to verify that the test can run in an isolated environment without any preconfiguration on your local machine.
```shell
docker build -t test -f test.Dockerfile .
```
A successful build from the above command indicates that all tests are passing on your local machine.
